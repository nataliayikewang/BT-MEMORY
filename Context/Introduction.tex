\subsection{Introduction}
Organizations tend to hold company events which 
require its employees to attend. Travel to these 
events inevitably leads to various expenditures 
incurred by employees, such as flights, accommodation, 
and meals. As long as these expenses are business-related 
and not for personal use, companies typically offer a 
reimbursement option. 

This is a common scenario within FSP's 
Barcelona team. FSP is a UK-founded private 
company and a leader in enterprise-level digital 
evolution and cybersecurity. FSP has successfully 
expanded its operations, establishing Barcelona as 
one of its several office locations. As expected, 
the Barcelona-based team frequently travels to the 
UK for corporate events, meetings and collaborative 
work, often struggling with high expenditures along 
the way. 

The current method for managing these expense claims 
relies on a manual and document-based workflow. To do 
that, Barcelona's team needs to gather all tickets, 
record them in Excel spreadsheets, and email them to 
the Finance Department for processing and approval.
