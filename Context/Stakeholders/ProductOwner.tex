\subsubsection{Product Owner}

The Product Owner is responsible for understanding the client's 
interests and communicating them effectively to the app development 
team. Their principal role is to maximize the value of the final 
product from the client's point of view. They define the product's 
vision and requirements, aligning the app's features with the client's 
interest throughout the app development lifecycle. In this case Sergio 
Alejandro Lobig Machado serves as Product Owner, as is the only 
representative of FSP in this project.
