\subsubsection{Development Team}

The app development team is responsible for implementing the 
entire application—from initial pipelines and database design 
and technology stack decisions to final testing and deployment 
of the product. At this moment, only the thesis author takes 
charge of this role. However, it does not preclude the possibility 
of extending and upgrading this project in the future, which would 
entail adding new developers to the team.
