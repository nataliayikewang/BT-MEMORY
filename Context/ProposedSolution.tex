\subsection{Proposed Solution}
FSP clearly needs a more intelligent, automated expense management 
strategy to prevent employee frustration and guarantee accurate 
reimbursement of business expenses. This project aims to develop 
an automated expense reporting web-app allowing employees to manage,
report, and submit expenses seamlessly on a single platform. 
The app digitizes the full workflow—from effortless receipt 
uploads to AI-powered data extraction and efficient verification 
and approval processes. 

The primary goal of this application is to simplify the previous 
expenses management workflow, optimize in terms of time and effort 
for all FSP parties,  minimize human error, and ensure the information 
is transmitted securely and efficiently to the appropriate approver.
