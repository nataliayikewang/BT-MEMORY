\subsection{Problems to Solve}
The existing hand-operated expense reporting system in FSP introduces 
significant inefficiencies. Submitting expense claims is time-consuming 
for employees, who must enter detailed information from receipts and 
whose goal is to get the exact reimbursement as soon as possible. At 
the same time, it becomes labor-intensive work for the Finance 
Department, which must verify and process refunds using outdated 
spreadsheets.

From FSP's perspective, this manual data entry and information 
submission is prone to human error—not only  increasing the risk 
of inaccuracies in financial reports but resulting in expenses 
being submitted to the wrong person as well. Alternatively, the 
time invested in this over-consuming activity could be considerably 
reduced, enabling highly skilled employees to focus on activities 
that deliver higher value to the company.
