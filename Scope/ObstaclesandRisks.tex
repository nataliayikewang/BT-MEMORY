\subsection{Obstacles and Risks}
Evaluating possible obstacles will lead to a more accurate project time estimation. 
Furthermore, identifying the risks that could impact the application's development 
is crucial. The following section outlines these potential obstacles and risks in detail.

\subsubsection{Coding Bugs}
As the application development progresses, it is inevitable that certain coding bugs will emerge, 
requiring additional time to fix. Since encountering such risks is highly probable, minor delays 
in the project are to be expected.


\subsubsection{Tight Project Deadlines}
The project timeline is constrained by the thesis deadline. As a consequence, the final product 
may not fully meet all the defined requirements. However, this represents a meaningful challenge 
for the author, as prioritizing specific application features is essential to deliver a high-value
 solution for FSP.


\subsubsection{Lack of Experience in Certain Technologies}
The two previous situations are quite common in real-world engineering practice, and this one 
is no exception. Exploring and applying new technologies is a constant challenge to a software 
engineer's daily work. However, the time dedicated to learning and becoming familiar with these 
technologies should be taken into account in the project timeline.
