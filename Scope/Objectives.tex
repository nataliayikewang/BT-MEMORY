\subsection{Objectives}

The main objective of this project is to \textbf{develop an expense reporting tool for FSP that addresses 
the company's priorities while tailoring web-app features to its specific context}. To achieve 
this goal, it will be broken down into smaller and simpler sub-objectives to make its scope 
easier to understand while facilitating the evaluation of its completion. The specific 
sub-objectives are outlined below:
