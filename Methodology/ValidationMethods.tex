\subsection{Validation Methods}
During each Agile sprint, the product is validated in every daily Scrum meeting 
and every sprint review as well. Agile facilitates the validation of this project, 
as it is reviewed continuously, keeping every new feature or change under control. 
Regarding technical validation, the application must pass several tests to ensure 
that its behaviour matches the discussed requirements. Finally, the thesis director 
will supervise the documentation throughout the project to ensure it meets the 
standards of a proper bachelor's thesis.
